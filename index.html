			<h2 class="heading2">About</h2>
			<p>As I write this, my son (to be named Arjun Anand Patel), is yet to be born. In his honor, my wife and I are launching the Arjun Wildlife Trust to deploy resources and funds around the world to help with conservation efforts and to combat poaching. I always told myself I would work hard to achieve financial independence and one day start a foundation to help the plight of many majestic species around the world. As I approach fatherhood at age 29, I realize the time is now. As populations of lions, tigers, elephants, rhinos and so many endangered species dwindle at an alarming rate, I know I don’t have the luxury of standing on the sidelines. My wife and I are personally committed to donating funds; our family business, Myriann, is committed to donating a percentage of profits each year; and we look to partner with our clients to gather additional resources and funds. All funds will go straight to the cause. Always.</p>
			<p>This is also an experiment and exercise in parenting. I hope the Arjun Wildlife Trust will help my wife and I establish core values with our son – work ethic, accountability, transparency, compassion, and charity. We not only want to improve the dire situation with so many species but we also want to use the foundation as a teaching tool for our son. As he gets older, he’ll learn to raise and manage funds, build a team of passionate supporters, and travel with his parents to see the funds at work.</p>
			<p>Whether this becomes his calling or not is to be determined. Frankly, it doesn’t matter. His birth has already inspired me to get started on a dream I’ve had since I was a kid. If he follows my footsteps, I’ll be proud. If he doesn’t, I’ll still be proud knowing that we gave him the tools he needed to succeed in something else.</p>
			<p>We’re humbled by all the love and support we’ve received with this foundation and ask that you follow our journey – and Arjun’s! – to help preserve species around the world.</p>
